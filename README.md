# CodeGen
#CodeGen is a program that uses TensorFlow and natural language processing (NLP) to automatically generate high-#quality code from natural language descriptions. It simplifies the process of writing code and makes it more #accessible to non-experts, and has the potential to revolutionize the way code is written and developed.

To use CodeGen, you will need to install TensorFlow and any additional dependencies required by the program. You will also need to provide CodeGen with a set of input and output data to use for training the model. Once the model is trained, you can use the generate_code method to generate code from natural language descriptions.
